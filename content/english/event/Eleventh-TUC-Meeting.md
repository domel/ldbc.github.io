LDBC Technical User Community meetings serve to (1) learn about progress
in the LDBC task forces on graph benchmark development, (2) to give
feedback on these, and (3) hear about user experiences with graph data
management technologies or (4) learn about new graph technologies from
researchers or industry -- LDBC counts Oracle, IBM, Intel, Neo4j and
Huawei among its members.

This TUC meeting will be a one-day event
preceding the [SIGMOD/PODS 2018](https://sigmod2018.org/) conference in Houston,
Texas (not too far away, the whole next week). Note also that at
SIGMOD/PODS in Houston on Sunday 10, there is a research workshop on
graph data management technology called [GRADES-NDA
2018](https://sites.google.com/site/gradesnda2018/) as
well, so you might combine travel.

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you are
interested to attend the event, please, contact Damaris Coll (UPC)
at <damaris@ac.upc.edu> to register;

**=\> registration is free, but required \<=**

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by other participants. We are specifically interested in learning
about new challenges in graph data management (where benchmarking would
become useful) and on hearing about actual user stories and scenarios
that could inspire benchmarks. Further, talks that provide feedback on
existing benchmark (proposals) are very relevant. But nothing is
excluded a priori if it is related to graph data management. Talk
proposals are handled by Peter Boncz (<boncz@cwi.nl>) and Larri
([larri\@ac.upc.edu](mailto:larri@ac.upc.ed)). Local
organizer is Juan Sequeda (<juanfederico@gmail.com>).

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership base.

### Agenda

In the TUC meeting there will be:

-   updates on progress with LDBC benchmarks, specifically the Social
    Network Benchmark (SNB) and its interactive, business analytics and
    graphalytics workloads.
-   talks by data management practitioners highlighting graph data
    management challenges and products

The  meeting will start on Friday morning,  with a program from
10:30-17:00:
